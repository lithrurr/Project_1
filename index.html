					<h3>Rebuilding the society</h3>
					<p>
						Junior high school student, Shoyo Hinata, becomes obsessed with volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School playing in Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by a player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's short but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's volleyball club – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help him practice.

					<h3>This drives us</h3>
					<p>
						There are several reasons why I love Haikyuu. The first one would be that Haikyuu is not all about Hinata and Kageyama. Sure, they are the main characters of the series but Furudate-sensei has done a good job giving other characters the spotlight highlighting their struggles, goals and their drive to play volleyball. Basically, it's not about Hinata and Kageyama stomping their opponents to reach the top but how each of the characters (whether they are teammates or opponents) push themselves to their very limits to achieve their goal which is centered to their love of volleyball.
